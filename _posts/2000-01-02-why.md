## What is a pixel?<br>Images and Dimensions

A **pixel** is a square unit of area on a digital screen. Pixels are laid out in grids, and each pixel displays a color.

An image's **size** is defined by the number of pixels wide and tall that image is. The number of pixels available in a specified dimension will determine the **quality** of the visual content in that space.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 50px;">
  <img src="./img/image-size.png" style="width: 450px;"/>
</div>

## Stretching the Limits?<br>The Raster Disaster
Pixels are very small - "invisible" to the eye - unless they are forced to behave outside of these dimensions. This most often happens to **rasterized** images (hardcoded, completed, set-in-stone) when they are resized beyond their original width.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 50px;">
  <img src="./img/image-pixel.gif" style="width: 450px;"/>
</div>

## What's the Resolution?<br>PPI and DPI
**Resolution** refers to how many pixels are contained in a square inch of a screen; say a computer or TV. The more pixels, the higher the quality.

There are many ways of referring to this amount. Designers (screen users) will usually refer to the **ppi** (pixels-per-inch) resolution, while printers will usually cite the **dpi** (dots-per-inch) of the image.

As a general rule, web graphics are made at **72ppi**, print graphics at **300dpi**. You may make a graphic that looks good on your _computer_ at 72ppi, but when you go to print it, it will look _pixelated_ and distorted.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 50px;">
  <img src="./img/image-resolution.png" style="width: 900px;"/>
</div>

## So now what?<br>Illustrator to the Rescue

Unlike Photoshop which works with raster images, Illustrator works in vectors. **Vectors** are not made up of square pixels; rather, they are made up of paths traced between points approximated by math.

Think of it as a line squares versus an algorithm between two points. Because this is all done with math and not a specific number of dots, dimensions can continually be calculated, despite the size of the graphic.

This makes vectors ideal for logos, as the _same graphic_ can be sized down to fit on a business card and blown-up for a billboard, all without losing quality.
